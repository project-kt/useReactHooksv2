title: useHoverOutside
description: This hook is designed to handle the 'mouseleave' event for a given element,
  which is useful for UI interactions where an action needs to be performed once the
  user's mouse leaves a particular area of the interface.

## Overview

The hook uses the `useEffect` to attach and detach the event listener to the element. The event listener
is only attached if the element exists (i.e., if `ref.current` is not null).

The dependency array of the `useEffect` includes only the callback function `fn` to ensure that the event listener
is updated if the callback changes. The `ref` object is not included to avoid unnecessary re-attachments of the
event listener due to changes in the ref object itself.

## Code

```tsx
"use client";

import { RefObject, useEffect } from "react";

const useHoverOutside = <T extends HTMLElement>(ref: RefObject<T>, fn: () => void) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const element = ref.current;

    if (element) {
      const handleMouseLeave = (event: MouseEvent) => fn();
      element.addEventListener("mouseleave", handleMouseLeave);

      return () => {
        element.removeEventListener("mouseleave", handleMouseLeave);
      };
    }
  }, [fn]); // Removed ref from dependency array to avoid unnecessary re-attachments
};

export default useHoverOutside;
```

## API

### Parameters

ref - A React ref object pointing to the target HTML element.

### Return

() => void - A callback function to be executed when the mouse leaves the element.

## Examples

```tsx
const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

useHoverOutside(ref, () => {
  console.log("Mouse has left the specified element");
});
```
