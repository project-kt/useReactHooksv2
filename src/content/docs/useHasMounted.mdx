title: useHasMounted
description: A custom React hook that determines if a component has mounted on the client side.
  This is useful for ensuring that certain hooks or components that rely on window or document objects
  are only executed in the client environment, especially useful in Next.js or other SSR frameworks.

## Code

```tsx
"use client";

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const useHasMounted = (): boolean => {
  const [hasMounted, setHasMounted] = useState<boolean>(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setHasMounted(true);

    // Cleanup function to reset the mounted state when the component unmounts
    return () => {
      setHasMounted(false);
    };
  }, []); // The empty dependency array ensures this effect runs only once after the initial render.

  return hasMounted;
};

export default useHasMounted;
```

## API

### Return

boolean - Returns true if the component has mounted on the client side, false otherwise.

## Examples

```tsx
const hasMounted = useHasMounted();

if (hasMounted) {
  // Perform client-specific logic such as accessing window or document
}
```
